üìù Step by step

`#!/bin/bash` ‚Üí Shebang, tells the system to use Bash.

`colors=("red" "green" "blue")` ‚Üí Declares an array named colors with 3 elements: "red", "green", "blue".

`for color in "${colors[@]}"` ‚Üí A for loop that goes through each element in the array.

`${colors[@]}` expands to all elements of the array.

Each time, the variable color takes one value (red, then green, then blue).

`do ... done` ‚Üí Loop body. Inside it, we run:
```bash
echo "Color: $color"
```

Which prints each color with the prefix "Color:".

**3.** `name="Aanya"` and `age=18` ‚Üí Define two variables:

* name stores the string "Aanya"

## Extra Questions

### What is the purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script?
* This is called the **shebang (#!)**.

* It tells the operating system which interpreter to use when running the script.

* In this case:

- `#!/bin/bash` ‚Üí use the Bash shell to run the commands.

- Without it, the script might run in another shell (like `sh`, `dash`, or `zsh`), and some Bash-specific features may not work.

### How to make a script executable?

**1.** Save the script.

**2.** Open a terminal in that directory.

**3.** Run this command:
```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```
* chmod = change file permissions
* +x = add "execute" permission

**4.** Now you can run it as:
```bash
./myscript.sh
```
