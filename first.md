Here is the updated **Markdown (.md) code** with an image example added under the `cp` command section. You can copy and save this as `file_commands.md`.

> 🖼️ For the image, you'll need to save a local or web-hosted image. I’ll use a placeholder path `images/cp-example.png`. Replace it with your actual image file path or URL.

# Linux File Commands: `cp`, `mv`, and `touch`

## 1. `touch` Command

### 📌 Purpose:
Creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.

### 🧪 Example:
```bash
touch file1.txt
````

This creates an empty file named `file1.txt` in the current directory.

---

## 2. `cp` Command

### 📌 Purpose:

Copies a file or directory.

### 🧪 Example:

```bash
cp file1.txt backup_file.txt
```

This creates a copy of `file1.txt` named `backup_file.txt` in the same directory.

### 🖼️ Visual Example:

![cp command example](images/cp-example.png)

> Replace `images/cp-example.png` with the actual image file path or URL.

---

## 3. `mv` Command

### 📌 Purpose:

Moves or renames files and directories.

### 🧪 Example: Moving one file to another folder

Assume you have a folder called `Documents` and a file `file1.txt`.

```bash
mv file1.txt Documents/
```

This moves `file1.txt` into the `Documents` folder.

### 🧪 Example: Renaming a file

```bash
mv file1.txt file_renamed.txt
```

This renames the file to `file_renamed.txt`.
